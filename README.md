# Weather forecast webapp

## Description

Travelers often need to plan their trip according to the weather as some outdoor activities may not be suitable in certain weathers. Having a website to go to for checking weather in just about any city in the world makes the trip planning a lot easier. Throughout this project, I learned how to make api calls, passing in specific parameters for the api calls.
